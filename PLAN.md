## Problem Statement

Immigrants filing **recurring USCIS renewals** — green-card renewal (Form I-90) and work-authorization renewal (Form I-765 / EAD) — juggle four disconnected tools: paid per-form filing wizards, a separate case-status tracker, manual deadline tracking, and scattered community forums. **Nothing remembers their data between filings**, so every renewal restarts from zero. With USCIS removing the EAD auto-extension for renewals filed on/after Oct 30, 2025, and I-90 processing stretching past 8 months, **missing a renewal window now risks a real gap in legal status or work authorization** — yet no single product helps a returning filer do it correctly, on time, and for free.

## Evidence

- **EAD renewals are slow and now timing-critical.** I-765 renewals take ~3–6 months on average in 2025; USCIS recommends filing up to 180 days before expiry; and the automatic 180-day extension was **removed for renewals filed on/after Oct 30, 2025** — a missed window can mean lost work authorization. ([immi-usa](https://www.immi-usa.com/work-permit-renewal/), [USCIS I-9 handbook §5.1](https://www.uscis.gov/i-9-central/form-i-9-resources/handbook-for-employers-m-274/50-automatic-extensions-of-employment-authorization-andor-employment-authorization-documents-eads-in/51-automatic-extensions-based-on-a-timely-filed-application-to-renew-employment-authorization))
- **I-90 waits are long and worsening:** up to 8+ months in 2026 (from ~4 months in 2025), range 6–24 months — long, anxious waits with no proactive guidance. ([CitizenPath](https://citizenpath.com/form-i-90-processing-time/), [Boundless processing times](https://www.boundless.com/immigration-resources/uscis-processing-times))
- **Demand for tracking + community is proven:** Lawfully reports 6M+ registered cases, 200K+ community posts, 3M+ comments — but it is a *tracker/community* app, not a filing tool. ([Lawfully](https://www.lawfully.com/), [Case Tracker](https://www.lawfully.com/case-tracker))
- **Filing is fragmented and paid per-form:** SimpleCitizen ($89/form, family bundles $299–$599), CitizenPath ($99/form, $299 annual membership), Boundless ($1,999+ for marriage GC, *explicitly no application tracking*). None build a reusable profile/document vault across renewals. ([SimpleCitizen](https://www.simplecitizen.com/), [Boundless tech firms](https://blog.myrawealth.com/insights/top-4-immigration-tech-firms))
- **The free incumbent is bare:** myUSCIS shows the last 5 case actions and email/SMS alerts, but features depend on form type and paper-filed cases are often view-only. ([Checking case status](https://www.uscis.gov/tools/checking-your-case-status-online))

## Proposed Solution

One **free** mobile app that combines guided renewal **filing + case tracking + a deadline calendar with proactive reminders + community**, built on a **persistent user profile and document vault** so the *second* filing is near one-tap. v1 deliberately targets the two most recurring, highest-anxiety renewals (I-90 and I-765) rather than complex one-time petitions, because recurrence is what proves the retention thesis. We win where competitors are siloed: filers get filing **and** tracking **and** deadline safety **and** a vault that remembers them — in one place, free at the point of use.

## Key Hypothesis

We believe a **persistent profile + document vault that makes renewals near one-tap**, paired with **proactive deadline reminders**, will drive repeat use among immigrants doing recurring USCIS filings.
We'll know we're right when **≥ 25% of activated users return to start a second application or renewal within 12 months** (north-star: retention).

## What We're NOT Building (v1)

- **Legal advice / attorney matching** — UPL (unauthorized practice of law) risk; v1 provides information and form assistance only, with disclaimers. Validate with counsel.
- **Non-US immigration systems** (Canada/IRCC, UK) — multiplies forms, news, and compliance.
- **Complex one-time petitions** (I-130/I-485 family, asylum) — high complexity, low recurrence; defer.
- **Discussion forum & news feed** — deferred to v1.1 (validate the filing+tracking+retention loop first).
- **Monetization** — free for now; revisit after the retention loop is proven.
- **Web app** — mobile (iOS + Android) only for v1.

## Success Metrics

| Metric | Target | How Measured |
|--------|--------|--------------|
| **Retention (north-star)** | ≥ 25% start a 2nd application/renewal within 12 mo | Analytics: distinct users with ≥2 applications |
| Activation | ≥ 60% of new accounts complete their 1st filing | Funnel: account → wizard complete |
| Reminder efficacy | ≥ 80% of due deadlines acted on before due date | Deadline acted-on / total due (pre-due) |
| Tracker engagement | ≥ 2 status checks/user/week during pending cases | WAU on tracker screen |
| Repeat-filing speed | 2nd filing ≥ 50% faster than 1st | Time-in-wizard, 1st vs 2nd application |

## Open Questions

- [ ] Product **name** + brand direction (TBD).
- [ ] Can we integrate the **USCIS case-status API** for real-time tracking, or must users enter status manually / via receipt number? (Feasibility spike — [USCIS developer APIs](https://developer.uscis.gov/apis).)
- [ ] How much of the **I-90 / I-765 form logic** do we encode ourselves vs. link out to USCIS online filing? (Defines the depth of the "filing" feature and the UPL boundary.)
- [ ] Document handling: do we **store uploaded documents** (passport, EAD, GC) or only metadata + reminders? (Big PII/compliance lever.)
- [ ] Exact retention target (25% is a hypothesis) — refine after first cohort.

## Users & Context

**Primary User**
- **Who**: Lawful permanent residents approaching the 10-year green-card renewal, and EAD holders (adjustment-of-status applicants, asylum-pending, DACA, certain visa categories) who renew employment authorization every 1–2 years. Phone-first, often non-native English speakers, anxious about deadlines and status.
- **Current behavior**: Manually checks myUSCIS/Case Status Online; tracks deadlines in their head or a calendar; pays a lawyer or a per-form tool; asks questions in scattered Facebook/Reddit groups.
- **Trigger**: Their green card or EAD is approaching expiry (the 180-day-before-expiry window), or they receive a USCIS notice.
- **Success state**: Renewal filed correctly and on time, status visible in one place, no lapse in status/work authorization — and next time, it's effortless.

**Job to Be Done**
When my green card or work permit is approaching expiry, I want to file the renewal correctly and on time without paying a lawyer, so I can keep my legal status and stop worrying about deadlines.

**Non-Users (v1)**
First-time or complex family/employment petitioners, asylum seekers needing legal counsel, and immigration attorneys (B2B) — all out of scope for v1. Non-US filers excluded.

## Solution Detail

### Core Capabilities (MoSCoW)

| Priority | Capability | Rationale |
|----------|------------|-----------|
| Must | Account + auth (Better Auth) | Identity anchor for a persistent, returning user |
| Must | Reusable applicant profile (personal/address/employment) | Autofills every future filing — the retention engine |
| Must | Document vault (user-owned, reused across filings) | Renewals reuse passport/EAD/GC docs; reminders on expiry |
| Must | Guided filing wizard for **I-90 + I-765** | The recurring, high-anxiety renewals v1 targets |
| Must | Case tracker (receipt #, status, history) | Proven demand (Lawfully); core anxiety reliever |
| Must | Deadline calendar + **push reminders** | The wedge — auto-extension removal makes timing critical |
| Must | Account + data deletion/export | Store-review requirement + GDPR/CCPA |
| Should | Profile/document autofill across applications | Makes the 2nd filing near one-tap (north-star driver) |
| Should | Document-expiry reminders (passport/EAD/GC) | Drives proactive return visits |
| Could | USCIS case-status API integration | Real-time tracking if feasible (else manual) |
| Could | Multi-language UI | Audience is often non-native English |
| Won't | Forum, news, monetization, legal advice, web | Deferred / out of scope (see "NOT Building") |

### MVP Scope

The **retention spine**: account → reusable profile → document vault → I-90 **or** I-765 guided wizard → case tracker → deadline calendar with push reminders → account deletion. Enough to test whether a returning filer comes back for a second renewal.

### User Flow (critical path to value)

1. Sign up → quick profile (name, status, current document + expiry date).
2. App immediately shows the **deadline** (e.g., "EAD expires in 142 days — file by [date]") → sets reminders.
3. User starts the renewal wizard → profile/vault pre-fills most fields → review → export/submit.
4. User adds the receipt number → tracker shows status + history; reminders continue.
5. Renewal approved → vault updated → next renewal is pre-loaded. (Return loop.)

<!-- STATUS: pending | in-progress | complete -->

| # | Phase | Description | Status | Parallel | Depends | PRP Plan |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|----------|---------|----------|
| 1 | Foundations | Auth, reusable profile, document vault, navigation skeleton, dev build, EAS env | pending | - | - | - |
| 2 | Backend core | Convex: schema, functions, API | pending | with 1 | - | - |
| 3 | Filing wizard | Dynamic I-90 + I-765 multi-step forms w/ profile/vault autofill | pending | - | 1, 2 | - |
| 4 | Tracker | Case CRUD, status history, (spike) USCIS API integration | pending | with 5 | 2 | - |
| 5 | Calendar + reminders | Deadlines UI, Convex cron, Expo push pipeline | pending | with 4 | 2 | - |
| 6 | Harden + ship | Tests, a11y, security/PII review, store submission, OTA | pending | - | 3, 4, 5 | - |

### Phase Details

**Phase 1: Foundations** — Goal: a returning user can sign in and has a profile + vault. Scope: Better Auth, `users`/`applicant_profile`/`documents` UI, tabs/stacks, dev build, EAS env. Success: account persists; profile + a document survive re-login.

**Phase 2: Backend core** — Goal:Convex schema, major Convex functions, API. Success: protected endpoint works; a document uploads via signed URL and re-downloads.

**Phase 3: Form Primitives** - Goal: create reusable form primitives that binds HeroUI Native/Pro components with Tanstack Form and Zod validation. Ultilize patterns such as [Form Groups](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/form-groups) and Form Composition (https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/form-composition), a guide on wrapping with UI lib can be found [here](https://tanstack.com/form/latest/docs/framework/react/guides/ui-libraries).

**Phase 4: Filing wizard** — Goal: complete an I-90 or I-765 renewal end-to-end. Scope: JSONB-driven multi-step form, autosave drafts, profile/vault pre-fill, review/export. Success: a renewal completes with most fields pre-filled from profile.

**Phase 5: Tracker** — Goal: see case status in one place. Scope: receipt entry, status + history, USCIS API spike. Success: a case shows current status + history.

**Phase 6: Calendar + reminders** — Goal: never miss a renewal window. Scope: deadlines from documents/cases, calendar UI, Convex cron, Expo push. Success: a device receives a scheduled due-date reminder.

**Phase 7: Harden + ship** — Goal: safe and in the stores. Scope: 80% coverage, a11y, security/PII review, account deletion, store assets, EAS submit + Update. Success: approved on both stores; OTA channel live.

## Decisions Log

| Decision | Choice | Alternatives | Rationale |
|----------|--------|--------------|-----------|
| Immigration system | US / USCIS | Canada, UK, multi | Largest market; public case-status + news; research baseline |
| v1 filing journeys | I-90 + I-765 renewals | N-400, I-130, H-1B | Highest recurrence → best fit for retention thesis; timing now critical |
| North-star metric | Retention / repeat use | Activation, engagement, revenue | Directly tests the core thesis |
| Business model | Free for now | Freemium, subscription, per-form | Prove the retention loop before monetizing; free undercuts paid filers |
| Backend | Convex | None | User choice; verified Convex path |
| Auth | Better Auth (self-hosted) | None | Owns PII (sensitive immigration data); Expo support |
| Dynamic form storage | JSONB on `applications` | None | JSONB fits variable per-type forms |

## Research Summary

**Market Context** — Filing (SimpleCitizen, CitizenPath, Boundless) and tracking/community (Lawfully, 6M+ cases) are *separate* products; filing is paid per-form; Boundless lacks tracking; myUSCIS is free but bare and form-dependent. **Gap: no one offers free guided renewal filing + tracking + reminders on a reusable profile/document vault.** Renewal timing is now high-stakes (EAD auto-extension removed Oct 30 2025; I-90 at 8+ months in 2026).
